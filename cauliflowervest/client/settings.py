Cauliflower Vest will encrypt the entire disk on this Mac.

It will also back up the recovery key for emergency purposes, like if you
forget your password.  It's very important that disk encryption is enabled
by Cauliflower Vest and *NOT* manually, to ensure that the recovery key is
backed up.

Upon success, you will see a final dialog box indicating that Cauliflower
Vest has encrypted your drive, stored the recovery key remotely, and that
you should restart.

If you do not see this final success message, you may not be secure. Please
contact Tech Support if you are not sure.
